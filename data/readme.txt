data

Contains sample data 

The data is listed in a format that formally conforms to RFC 7940 so as to
allow the use of toolsets for LGRs in the RFC 7940 defind xml format.

Note that the tables are not themselves workable Label Generation Rulesets,
but rather identify code points and code point sequences that will need
special handling in actual LGRs.

See "Description" for background and detailed explanations of conventions
